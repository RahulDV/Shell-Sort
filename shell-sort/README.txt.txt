This zip file contains 
1) Source code for the project.
2) Output data and graphs are present in the Microsoft Excel file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I followed a naming convention while naming these files:

LinearlyScaledShellSort : source code pertaining to empirical analysis of shellsort for linearly increasing array-sizes. 

LogarithmicScaledShellSort : source code pertaining to empirical analysis of shellsort for logarithmically increasing array-sizes.

DividedLogarithmicScaledShellSort : source code pertaining to empirical analysis of shellsort for logarithmically increasing array-sizes and the outputs are divided by Lg(n!).

DividedLinearScaledShellSort : source code pertaining to empirical analysis of shellsort for linearly increasing array-sizes and the outputs are divided by Lg(n!).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It would be preferred if the source code is executed in the Eclipse under proper package structure as specified in the source code.

The programs are atomic and can be run as individual java program. They have no dependency on any additional libraries other than those provided by java runtime.
